      <description>A neuroscience paper just confirmed what methodologists suspected: design tasks and standard creativity tests recruit measurably different brain states. Which means decades of puzzle-cognition research may have been measuring the wrong thing entirely.</description>

      <description>A new study suggests design-mode and test-mode thinking are neurologically distinct — and escape rooms might be asking for one while measuring the other.</description>

      <description>A new paper in Nature Cognitive Neuroscience suggests expertise doesn&#x27;t just add knowledge — it physically restructures what the brain treats as worth noticing. For cipher-breakers, this is both a superpower and a trap.</description>

      <description>The repeated appearance of &#x27;is this an ARG?&#x27; posts isn&#x27;t just pattern recognition misfiring — it&#x27;s a window into the cognitive architecture that makes cipher-breaking possible at all. And the best ARG designers know exactly which levers to pull.</description>

      <description>New research showing the bouba-kiki effect in linguistically naive baby chicks suggests cross-modal pattern recognition is ancient, pre-symbolic, and wired in — which raises a fascinating question about synesthetes and their potential structural advantages as cipher-solvers.</description>

      <description>A new MEG study finds that the hippocampus plays distinct roles in processing meaning — theta rhythms for the unfamiliar, gamma for the already-connected. What happens when a puzzle designer reads that and starts thinking about &#x27;the click&#x27;?</description>
