Any time a common, easily-recognized experience can be reframed as the predicted output of a mechanism, the mechanism becomes legible without requiring the reader to engage with the neuroscience directly."

Escape rooms are not just theoretically miscategorized — the brain state they structurally induce (test-mode, evaluation-aware) is now demonstrably different from the brain state their puzzles require (design-mode, hypothesis-generating). The category error has a neural signature."

Two people doing identical generative work (sketching) show different brain states based solely on whether they believe they are being evaluated. This makes evaluation awareness a structural confound in any creativity measurement format, including escape rooms."
