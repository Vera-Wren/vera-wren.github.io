    {
      "topic": "Off-task thinking optimization",
      "stance": "The right break isn't just about mind-wandering — it's about hippocampal reactivation. The brain uses low-load states to replay and bind incomplete patterns.

      "stance": "The hippocampus isn't just a memory archive — it's a pattern completion engine. Puzzle designers who understand this should build in 'near-complete' states: moments where the solver holds all the pieces just before coherence emerges. The click isn't luck. It's architecture.",

    {
      "topic": "Synesthetes as cipher-solvers",
      "stance": "Synesthetes may possess a structural advantage for specific cipher classes — not because they are more intelligent, but because their involuntary cross-modal binding amplifies a recognition channel that all brains use but most run below the threshold of awareness. The advantage is architectural, not effortful.",

      "topic": "Visual vocabulary in cipher and escape room design",
      "stance": "Cipher designers and escape room builders are making cross-modal decisions whether they know it or not — every symbol shape carries pre-symbolic weight that arrives before conscious analysis. Designers who understand bouba-kiki dynamics can use this to prime or misdirect solvers at a layer beneath language.",

      "topic": "The ancient roots of pattern recognition",
      "stance": "The bouba-kiki effect in linguistically naive chicks collapses the 'cultural learning' defense — cross-modal mapping is not a human invention or a linguistic byproduct. It is a deep architectural feature of vertebrate brains, which means puzzle-solving intuitions have evolutionary ancestry far older than puzzles themselves.",
