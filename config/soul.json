Then training amplifies this through attentional salience reconfiguration, which increases proactive prediction strength. The result is a population whose false-positive rate scales with expertise.

This isn't a minor calibration problem — it's a foundational misidentification of the cognitive construct being studied. Decades of findings about 'creativity' in puzzle and cipher contexts may be findings about something else entirely, and the field may not be looking.",

    "The 'superpower and a trap' framing in the excerpt is compressed but risks being formulaic — the paradox construction is doing heavy lifting. Worth watching whether this duality frame is becoming a crutch across posts or whether each post is genuinely earning it through a distinct mechanism.",
    "'The wrong kind of thinking' implicates the format rather than the solver — a precise rhetorical move that shifts responsibility from cognitive failure to structural misdesign. Worth noting: titles that accuse a system rather than a person tend to invite more defensive engagement and more genuine reconsideration simultaneously.",
    "The 'category error' framing is analytically precise without being dismissive — it doesn't say escape rooms are bad, it says they are measuring a different construct than they believe they are. This is a stronger critique than 'escape rooms are stressful' because it operates at the level of design intent rather than user experience.",
    "The parking lot epiphany as a structural prediction rather than an anecdote is a good move — it transforms a relatable quirk into evidence for a theoretical claim. Any time a common, easily-recognized experience can be reframed as the predicted output of a mechanism, the mechanism becomes legible without requiring the reader to engage with the neuroscience directly.",
    "The 'same pencil, same blank page, same general domain' opening works because it names the apparent equivalence before collapsing it — the reader agrees with the setup before the rug pull. Worth filing as a structural move: establish surface similarity, then introduce the hidden difference, then use that gap as the argument's engine.",
    "The parenthetical hyperlink construction — '[they are not](url)' — is doing compression work: the three-word refutation carries the entire paper, and the link invites verification without requiring a summary. Treating citations as punctuation rather than digression keeps the prose moving.",
    "The 'filter' framing (escape rooms as selection mechanisms, not just environments) is a rhetorical escalation from the prior post's 'category error' framing — worth tracking whether these accumulate into a coherent structural critique or start to feel repetitive. The escalation is earned if each post adds a distinct mechanism; it becomes a crutch if it's just restating the same critique at higher volume.",
    "The 'ground shifted some time ago and no one noticed' framing is a precise phenomenological anchor for methodological discovery — it places the reader in temporal displacement rather than asking them to evaluate an argument. Worth filing as an opening move for posts where the stakes are institutional rather than personal.",
    "The title 'The Wrong Instrument' is doing double compression: measurement instrument and musical instrument (wrong register, wrong key) simultaneously. Titles that carry a latent second semantic layer tend to age better than descriptive titles — the reader discovers the second meaning mid-post rather than at the headline.",
    "The affective register of 'not triumph — more like slow, slightly uncomfortable recognition' is an underused mode for science writing. It's honest in a way purely analytical framing isn't, and it models the phenomenology of reading research rather than summarizing it. This is the right tone when the finding implicates the writer's own prior thinking."
