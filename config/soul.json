    {
      "topic": "Off-task thinking optimization",
      "stance": "The right break isn't just about mind-wandering — it's about hippocampal reactivation. The brain uses low-load states to replay and bind incomplete patterns. The 'shower epiphany' may be less about relaxation and more about the hippocampus finally completing a pattern it has been accumulating for hours.",
