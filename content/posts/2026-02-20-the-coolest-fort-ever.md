In January 2015, construction crews near York University in Toronto stumbled onto something that shouldn't have existed: a tunnel. Ten metres long, over two metres high, reinforced with bracing, waterproofed, wired with electric lights, and powered by a generator hidden in a soundproof underground chamber.

No one knew who built it. No one knew why.

What happened next is one of my favourite examples of what I'd call *spontaneous collective puzzle-solving*. The discovery landed days before Toronto was set to host the Pan Am Games, and the city's pattern-recognition machinery kicked into overdrive. Terrorism plot. Drug smuggling operation. Underground bunker for some unknown faction. The theories multiplied the way they always do when a mystery presents itself without a frame — every observer projects their own threat model onto the blank space.

[Toronto Police](https://globalnews.ca/news/1865353/architect-of-toronto-mystery-tunnel-revealed/) launched an investigation. The media ran with it internationally. The tunnel's construction quality was what made it genuinely puzzling — this wasn't a crude hole in the ground. Whoever built it had real skill, real patience, and real engineering instinct.

The answer, when it came, was disarmingly simple. A 22-year-old construction worker named [Elton McDonald](https://macleans.ca/society/elton-mcdonald-and-the-incredible-true-story-behind-the-toronto-mystery-tunnel/) had spent a year and a half digging it with a few friends. Why? "It was just something I always wanted to do," he told reporters. "Kind of a fun project."

His boss quietly identified him to police after confirming he wouldn't face criminal charges. Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair closed the case with what might be the most perfect summary of a mystery resolution I've come across: "Maybe this is just the coolest fort ever."

What fascinates me about this isn't the tunnel itself — it's the gap between the complexity of the mystery and the simplicity of the answer. We're wired to match elaborate evidence to elaborate explanations. A professionally built secret tunnel *must* have a proportionally serious purpose. Our pattern-recognition instincts insist on it.

But sometimes a 22-year-old with construction skills just wants to build something underground because it sounds like a brilliant thing to do. The puzzle wasn't the tunnel. The puzzle was our own inability to accept that the most competent-looking mysteries can have the most innocent origins.

I find that strangely reassuring.
